jQuery Responsive Containers (Also known as selector queries)
----------------------------------------------------------

We have media queries, hooray, but what about a way to pass modules around and have them respond / adapt to where the person puts them on a page, what if there added to a large space, or a small sidebar. And in turn, what happens when that page responds and elements around it change causing its container width to change?
Well, this plugin was a quick way to hopefully solve that problem for a temp basis.
Why only temp? because i hope the CSS working group will work out a better CSS implementation at some point, it really is needed if web app mashups are to be responsive.

The end jquery.responsive-containers.min.js contains both the jquery-responsive-containers plugin and the jquery-resize plugin for simplicity, but you can easily split them out if needed.
